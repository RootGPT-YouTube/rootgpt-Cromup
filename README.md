# rootgpt-rep: cromup
Instruction:  
  
LINUX:  
Open terminal and copy and paste this command:  
`sudo git clone https://github.com/RootGPT-YouTube/rootgpt-Cromup.git && sudo chmod a+x ~/rootgpt-Cromup/install.sh && ~/rootgpt-Cromup/install.sh`  
This command will download the needed files for Cromite Browser installation (Cromite is created by UAZO, is not my work) and will install it.  
If Cromite is already installed with my script, you can update the browser with `cromup` terminal command.  
  
WINDOWS:  
Download WinCromup.bat (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RootGPT-YouTube/rootgpt-Cromup/refs/heads/main/WinCromup.bat`)  
Right click on downloaded WinCromup.bat files and `Run like Administrator`. Cromite Browser will be installed and ready to launch from the Start menu link in just a few minutes.  
If Cromite is already installed with my script, you can update the browser always with WinCromup.bat.  
  
Enjoy the best browser!  
If you find bugs, report it to me, thx!
