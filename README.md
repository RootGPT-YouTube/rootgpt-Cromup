# rootgpt-rep: cromup
Instruction:  
Open terminal and write:  
`git clone https://github.com/RootGPT-YouTube/rootgpt-Cromup.git`  
Enter in the downloaded directory:  
`cd rootgpt-Cromup`  
Make the file `install.sh` executable:  
`sudo chmod a+x install.sh`  
Launch the install.sh file:  
`./install.sh`  
This command will download the needed files for Cromite Browser installation and will install it.  
If Cromite is already installed, you can update it with `cromup` terminal command.  
Now, if you want, you can delete the rootgpt-Cromup directory:  
`cd .. && rm -fr rootgpt-Cromup/`  
Finally, you can enjoy the best browser!  
PS: Known bugs (if you can, you can help me!):  
In KDE, the icon in the menu must be created using the Menu Editor (kmenuedit).  
In some DEs, the Chromium icon will appear instead of the Cromite one.
